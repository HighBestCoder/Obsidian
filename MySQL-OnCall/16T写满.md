修的办法：把用户的storage size改成20T，也就是migration mode的最后那一步。

RCA: Azure Database for MySQL False Positive Storage Full  
IMPACT:  
From xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx to xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx, your Azure Database for MySQL server xxxxx encountered some failures on inserting/updating data. The client may receive errors like “The table xxx is full”.  
ROOT CAUSE:  
Azure Database for MySQL is running on top of Azure Storage for data storage. Recently Azure Storage rolled out a behavior change related to the storage usage calculation. While we identified some compatibility issues, TRUNCATE TABLE in MySQL may lead to inconsistent storage usage statistics, and potentially lead to false positive storage full and write failures.  
MITIGATION & SOLUTION:  
We applied some workarounds to your server to prevent it from hitting this issue again.  
While to completely fix the issue, multiple components need to be updated, including some OS virtualization layers, so the fixing and patching procedure may take quite a long time. So far, we don’t have a finalized ETA.  
We have more control on the I/O layer of Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server, so this issue has already been fixed on the new platform, and the patch will be rolled out in the next month. It has quite a lot of new features, better out-of-box performance, and more flexibility for customers. We recommend our customers try the new platform and perform the migration if applicable.
